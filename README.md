# wow-westminster-archive
Based on the art installation [*WOW Westminster*](http://www.vancouverbiennale.com/artworks/wow-new-westminster/) by José Resende. The repo holds the flat files for the exhibit that responds to José Resende's work by presenting an archive of photographs taken of the installation's "W" made out of shipping containers. [The website](http://watchtheedge.ca/wow-westminster-archive/) tries to explore Point-of-view and perspective through a series of photos that reveal different features of Resende's piece. The exhibit challenges readers to explore questions about the text: what are we looking at? what is the reader thinking and how do we know?
